# RISC-V Single Cycle Processor Design
Welcome to the RISC-V Single Cycle Processor repository! This project contains the Verilog code and testbench for a RISC-V single cycle processor, with each logic block designed and simulated to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the processor's functionality.

This repository includes the following files:

## Verilog Code: 
Implementations of each module in the RISC-V processor.
## Testbench: 
Testbenches to verify the functionality of each module.
## Elaborated Design:
The design of each module.

Explore the detailed implementations and simulation results to gain insights into the design and operation of each block in the RISC-V single cycle processor.

eedback are welcome!
